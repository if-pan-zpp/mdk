# MDK

Welcome to the _Molecular Dynamics Kit_ (MDK) project.

## Testing notes

- Disulfide bridges (both formation and SSBONDS) are for now unimplemented;
- The system is really fucking slow;
- Also, the system at goes ballistic at some point which causes verlet list reconstructions; this may be the cause of this behavior;
